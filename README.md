# SMS-Coastal
This is the repository of the current version of the Simulation Management System for Coastal Operational Models (SMS-Coastal), developed at the Centre for Marine and Environmental Research (CIMA) of the University of Algarve (UAlg) in Portugal.
## Overview
SMS-Coastal is a program written using Python programming language and is designed to automate all the processes involved in the operational forecasting of coastal models. It was developed coupled to the MOHID System ([MOHID Official repository](https://github.com/Mohid-Water-Modelling-System/Mohid), but SMS-Coastal was programmed based on a generic methodology that can be applied to any other model.
